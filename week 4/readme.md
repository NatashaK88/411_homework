FIrst i added two more options to my story on the jacvascript. It wasn't working after I did that. Turns out my makeChoice function was inside my if else statement. When i got that fixed my clouds picture was not working and i had to change the ending to jpg instead of jpeg. Then I added the pop up window when you first arrive to the page. Then I didn't know what to do when it came to adding a loop so I used chatgpt I gave it my code and asked if it would help me. I didn't like the first option so it gave me another and it choose a while loop. I liked it so i added it in. I used it again to add a counter for every choice that was made. It totals it up and adds it together at the end to show you how many choices you made.
