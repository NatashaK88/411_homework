  When I look at the world i see alot of people struggling to get by and making up the answeres as they go
  or maybe that's just me? I say i see people struggling because alot of my friends and family are right now
  for various reasons. We all just drink our redbulls and power through the day. We try to love and learn something new
  we try to accomplish everything we can manage in a day. This last semester I experienced a lot of loss and I am
  trying to make sence of a world that doesn't make sence. But i think that's how it is for alot of people. I lost my
  grandpa and my dog in the picture he was almost 14 I had had him since he was 10 weeks old. I loved them both deeply.
