Making a quick website was easy I just pulled up one I had done and changed the 
words and picture. I had originally really liked the colors of my website but as
time goes on I'm not sure I like them but I don't know what needs to be changed.
I'm not sure if the blue needs to change or the lighter color needs to be more
of a white? Getting everything set up is what really drove me crazy because my
homepage had a 404 code and would not display anything. After two days of trying
to mess with it, it randomly just started working and I'm not sure what I did that
fixed it. I went back and deleted a lot of things and reuploaded them and maybe that
is what did it? I'm really not sure. I didn't understand the hero image and how to get the picture added to it? I plan to mess with it some more but for now, I went with something simple. I have this website in my mind that is anything but simple I'm not even sure if it's possible but I hope after this semester the dream website I have will be possible.
