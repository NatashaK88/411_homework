The main differences between ChatGPT and my version are they put favorite websites in a console.log and I put that in a comment. Of course we had different favorites. The code however is exactly the same.

I could explain the way chatGPT the code that ChatGPT used because we used the same basic code. I do not thing the work is mine because I did not create it.
