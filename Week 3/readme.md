I started with setting up my files and folders. Then my girlfriend and I made a little story together and I found images to go along with them. I first made most of the HTML and CSS because I understood that part better. When I got to the javascript it took me forever to figure out how many = to put in the if else section. After reading and playing around with things I figured out some parts needed one and some parts needed 3 =. I was mostly trying to use two. I also figured out that I prefer to use "" over '' because it wouldn't add the s after Hippo's because of the grammar. My CSS file was not working and I had forgotten the ./css I just had css/. I looked at the homework before doing any of the reading and was a little overwhelmed at first. After reading and practicing and looking up stuff like how to add images in the Javascript section, it wasn't as hard as I expected. Doing the code academy has been helpful and they have a lot of great resources if you get stuck. Everything is just time-consuming this is my first time doing JavaScript so everything is brand new. It takes a while to figure out where to start and what language to use.
